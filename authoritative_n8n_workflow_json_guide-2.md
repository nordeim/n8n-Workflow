## 1. Introduction to n8n and the Importance of the JSON Format

### What is n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows users to connect various applications and services to automate complex tasks. With a visual, node-based approach, users can build workflows that process data, make decisions, and interact with a multitude of APIs.

### Why Understand the JSON Format?

Every workflow you create in the n8n UI is stored in the background as a JSON document. This JSON document is the "source of truth" for your workflow. A deep understanding of this format opens up a world of possibilities that go beyond visual editing. It allows you to:

*   **Programmatic Automation:** Create and modify workflows as part of your CI/CD pipelines or other automated processes.
*   **Versioning:** Treat your workflows like code by storing and managing them in version control systems like Git.
*   **Reusability and Templating:** Create templates and reusable workflow components that can be dynamically customized.
*   **Troubleshooting and Debugging:** Understand the exact configuration and data flows at a granular level.
*   **Bulk Changes:** Perform complex changes to many nodes at once, which can be tedious in the user interface.

### Use Cases for Directly Editing JSON

*   **Dynamic Workflow Generation:** An application could generate a custom n8n workflow as JSON based on user input and import it via the n8n API.
*   **DevOps and GitOps:** Store workflow JSONs in a Git repository. Changes to the repository automatically trigger the deployment of the updated workflow to your n8n instance.
*   **Migrations:** Migrate workflows between different n8n instances or programmatically update them to new node versions.
*   **Integration into Custom Platforms:** Embed n8n functionality into your own applications by dynamically creating and executing workflows.

## 2. The Basic Structure of an n8n Workflow JSON

An n8n workflow JSON is an object with several top-level properties. Let's examine the most important ones.

### Top-Level Properties

*   `name` (String): The name of the workflow as it appears in the n8n UI.
*   `nodes` (Array): An array of objects, where each object represents a node in the workflow. This is the heart of the workflow.
*   `connections` (Array): An array of objects that defines the connections between the nodes. It determines the workflow's execution path.
*   `active` (Boolean): Indicates whether the workflow is active or not. An inactive workflow will not be triggered automatically.
*   `settings` (Object): Contains workflow-specific settings like timezone, error workflow, etc.
*   `id` (String): A unique identifier for the workflow, generated by n8n upon saving.
*   `tags` (String): A comma-separated list of tags for organizing workflows.

### Dissecting a Simple "Hello World" Example

Let's look at an extremely simple workflow that is triggered manually and outputs "Hello World."

**Workflow in the UI:**
Start -> Set

**The resulting JSON:**

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World Workflow",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {},
      "id": "0f6b4d3d-4f1e-4a6c-8b2b-1d7f2e9c5a1a",
      "name": "Start",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.start",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [
        250,
        300
      ]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "values": {
          "string": [
            {
              "name": "message",
              "value": "Hello World"
            }
          ]
        },
        "options": {}
      },
      "id": "e9f3a6c1-3c5d-4b9a-8e7d-9f2c1b4a0f8e",
      "name": "Set Message",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.set",
      "typeVersion": 1.2,
      "position": [
        450,
        300
      ]
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "source": {
        "node": "0f6b4d3d-4f1e-4a6c-8b2b-1d7f2e9c5a1a"
      },
      "target": {
        "node": "e9f3a6c1-3c5d-4b9a-8e7d-9f2c1b4a0f8e"
      }
    }
  ],
  "active": false,
  "settings": {},
  "id": "1",
  "tags": ""
}
```

**Analysis:**

*   **`nodes` Array:** We have two nodes.
    *   The first is a `Start` node (`n8n-nodes-base.start`). It has no special `parameters`.
    *   The second is a `Set` node (`n8n-nodes-base.set`). Under `parameters.values.string`, we define a new property named `message` with the value "Hello World".
    *   Each node has a unique `id` (a UUID), a `name`, a `type`, and a `position` for its display in the UI.
*   **`connections` Array:** There is a single connection.
    *   It goes from the `Start` node (identified by its `id` in `source.node`) to the `Set` node (identified by its `id` in `target.node`).

---

## 3. A Deep Dive into the `nodes` Property

The `nodes` property is an array containing the building blocks of your workflow. Each node is a JSON object with a specific structure.

### Common Node Properties

*   **`parameters` (Object):** This is the most important field. It contains the specific configuration for the respective node type. Its structure varies greatly between different nodes.
*   **`id` (String):** A unique UUID that identifies the node within the workflow. This ID is used in the `connections` property to establish links. It is crucial that these IDs are unique within a workflow.
*   **`name` (String):** The user-defined name of the node displayed in the UI.
*   **`type` (String):** The internal type of the node. It follows the pattern `<package-name>.<node-name>`, e.g., `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`.
*   **`typeVersion` (Number):** The version of the node type. This allows n8n to handle changes to nodes over time.
*   **`position` (Array):** An array of two numbers `[x, y]` that defines the coordinates of the node in the visual editor.
*   **`credentials` (Object):** If a node uses credentials (e.g., for an API), a reference to them is stored here. We will look at this in more detail later.

### Trigger Nodes: Anatomy and Examples

Trigger nodes are the starting point of every workflow. They have no input connections.

#### Example: `Webhook` Node

A Webhook trigger waits for incoming HTTP requests.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "path": "my-webhook-path-12345",
    "responseMode": "onReceived",
    "options": {}
  },
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6",
  "name": "Webhook Trigger",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
  "typeVersion": 1,
  "position": [
    250,
    300
  ],
  "webhookId": "xyz-abc-123"
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `httpMethod`: The expected HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
*   `path`: The unique path for the webhook endpoint.
*   `responseMode`: Defines when the response is sent to the caller (`onReceived`, `lastNode`, etc.).
*   **`webhookId`**: This property at the top level of the node object (not inside parameters) is used internally by n8n to register the webhook.

#### Example: `Cron` Node

A Cron node triggers the workflow at scheduled times.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "rule": "0 10 * * 1-5"
  },
  "id": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-b8c9-d0e1-f2a3b4c5d6e7",
  "name": "Cron",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.cron",
  "typeVersion": 1,
  "position": [
    250,
    300
  ]
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `rule`: A Cron expression that defines the schedule. In this case: "At 10:00 AM on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday."

### Regular Nodes: Detailed Analysis of Common Node Types

Let's examine the `parameters` structure of some of the most frequently used nodes.

#### `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`

This node is essential for communicating with external APIs.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
    "method": "POST",
    "authentication": "predefinedCredential",
    "credentialType": "httpHeaderAuth",
    "sendBody": true,
    "bodyContentType": "json",
    "jsonBody": "={{ JSON.stringify($json) }}",
    "options": {
      "splitOutput": "mainOutput"
    }
  },
  "id": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2-a3b4c5d6e7f8",
  "name": "Send to API",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",
  "typeVersion": 4.1,
  "position": [
    450,
    300
  ],
  "credentials": {
    "httpHeaderAuth": {
      "id": "42",
      "name": "My API Auth"
    }
  }
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `url`: The target URL of the API.
*   `method`: The HTTP method.
*   `authentication`: Specifies the type of authentication. Here `predefinedCredential`, which means we are using stored credentials.
*   `credentialType`: The type of credential referenced in the node's `credentials` object.
*   `sendBody`: `true` if a request body should be sent.
*   `bodyContentType`: The type of the body, here `json`.
*   `jsonBody`: The content of the JSON body. Note the expression `={{ JSON.stringify($json) }}`, which converts the incoming item's JSON data into a string and sends it as the body.
*   **`credentials` object (outside parameters):** This is where the specific credential is referenced. `id: "42"` is the ID of the credential in the n8n database.

#### `n8n-nodes-base.if`

The If node allows for conditional branching in the workflow.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "conditions": {
      "string": [
        {
          "value1": "={{ $json.status }}",
          "operation": "equal",
          "value2": "success"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "id": "d4e5f6a7-b8c9-d0e1-f2a3-b4c5d6e7f8g9",
  "name": "Check Status",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.if",
  "typeVersion": 1,
  "position": [
    650,
    300
  ]
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `conditions`: An object containing the conditions. It can contain `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc., arrays.
*   `value1`: The first value for the comparison. Here, an expression that accesses the `status` field of the incoming JSON.
*   `operation`: The comparison operator (e.g., `equal`, `notEqual`, `contains`, `startsWith`).
*   `value2`: The second value for the comparison.

An If node has two outputs: one for `true` (index 0) and one for `false` (index 1). This becomes important in the `connections`.

#### `n8n-nodes-base.set`

The Set node is used to add new fields or modify existing ones.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "values": {
      "string": [
        {
          "name": "fullName",
          "value": "={{ $json.firstName }} {{ $json.lastName }}"
        }
      ],
      "number": [
        {
          "name": "age",
          "value": 30
        }
      ]
    },
    "keepOnlySet": false,
    "options": {}
  },
  "id": "e5f6a7b8-c9d0-e1f2-a3b4-c5d6e7f8g9h0",
  "name": "Prepare Data",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.set",
  "typeVersion": 1.2,
  "position": [
    850,
    300
  ]
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `values`: An object that groups the values to be set by data type (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `json`).
    *   Each object in the array has a `name` (the name of the field) and a `value` (the value, which can be static or an expression).
*   `keepOnlySet`: If `true`, only the fields defined in this node will be passed on to the next node. Otherwise, they are added to the existing data.

#### `n8n-nodes-base.function`

For complex logic that goes beyond simple expressions, the Function node provides a JavaScript environment.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "functionCode": "const items = [];\nfor (const item of $items) {\n  item.json.processed = true;\n  item.json.processedAt = new Date().toISOString();\n  items.push(item);\n}\nreturn items;"
  },
  "id": "f6a7b8c9-d0e1-f2a3-b4c5-d6e7f8g9h0i1",
  "name": "Custom Logic",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.function",
  "typeVersion": 1,
  "position": [
    1050,
    300
  ]
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `functionCode`: A string containing the JavaScript code.
    *   `$items` is a special variable representing an array of all incoming items.
    *   The code must return an array of items to be passed to the next node.

#### `n8n-nodes-base.merge`

This node combines data from two different input streams.

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "mode": "mergeByPosition",
    "join": "inner"
  },
  "id": "g7b8c9d0-e1f2-a3b4-c5d6-e7f8g9h0i1j2",
  "name": "Merge Data",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.merge",
  "typeVersion": 1.1,
  "position": [
    1250,
    400
  ]
}
```

**Analysis of `parameters`:**

*   `mode`: The method of merging. Common values are `mergeByPosition` (item 1 from input 1 with item 1 from input 2) and `mergeByKey` (merging based on matching key values).
*   `join`: The type of join (`inner`, `left`, `right`, `outer`).

The Merge node is special because it has two inputs (`input_0` and `input_1`), which is reflected in the `connections`.

---

## 4. The `connections` Property Decrypted

The `connections` property defines the "flow" of the workflow. It's an array of connection objects. Each object describes a single link from an output port of one node to an input port of another. The simplest and most common format is a direct `source` and `target` pairing.

### Connection Structure

A typical connection object looks like this:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "node": "source_node_id",
    "port": 0
  },
  "target": {
    "node": "target_node_id",
    "port": 0
  }
}
```

The entire `connections` property at the top level of the workflow JSON is an array of these objects.

### Understanding `source`, `target`, and `port`

*   **`source`**: The object defining the connection's starting point.
    *   `node` (String): The `id` of the source node.
    *   `port` (Number, optional): The index of the output port. Defaults to `0`. For nodes like "If", `0` is the "true" output and `1` is the "false" output.
*   **`target`**: The object defining the connection's endpoint.
    *   `node` (String): The `id` of the target node.
    *   `port` (Number, optional): The index of the input port. Defaults to `0`. For nodes like "Merge", `0` is the first input and `1` is the second.

### Examples of Simple and Complex Connections

**Simple linear connection:** `Start` -> `Set`

```json
"connections": [
  {
    "source": { "node": "start-node-id" },
    "target": { "node": "set-node-id" }
  }
]
```

**Conditional branching with an If node:**

```
      /-> (True) -> Set_Success_Message
Start -> If
      \-> (False) -> Set_Failure_Message
```

```json
"connections": [
  { "source": { "node": "start-node-id" }, "target": { "node": "if-node-id" } },
  {
    "source": { "node": "if-node-id", "port": 0 }, // True output
    "target": { "node": "set-success-id" }
  },
  {
    "source": { "node": "if-node-id", "port": 1 }, // False output
    "target": { "node": "set-failure-id" }
  }
]
```

**Merging with a Merge node:**

```
Branch_A -> \
             Merge -> Final_Node
Branch_B -> /
```

```json
"connections": [
  { "source": { "node": "branch-a-id" }, "target": { "node": "merge-node-id", "port": 0 } },
  { "source": { "node": "branch-b-id" }, "target": { "node": "merge-node-id", "port": 1 } },
  { "source": { "node": "merge-node-id" }, "target": { "node": "final-node-id" } }
]
```

---

## 5. `settings` and `staticData`: Configuring Your Workflow

### Workflow Settings

The `settings` object contains metadata and configurations that affect the behavior of the entire workflow.

```json
"settings": {
  "errorWorkflow": "error-workflow-id-123",
  "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "executionTimeout": 3600
}
```

*   `errorWorkflow`: The ID of another workflow to be executed if this workflow fails.
*   `timezone`: The timezone in which the workflow runs. This is important for Cron jobs and date operations.
*   `executionTimeout`: The maximum execution time in seconds before the workflow is terminated.

### Handling `staticData`

The `staticData` property is a mechanism for persisting data between different workflow executions. It's less commonly edited directly, but it's good to know it exists.

```json
"staticData": {
  "node-id-123": {
    "lastRun": "2025-06-29T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

This can be useful, for example, to store the timestamp of the last successful run and fetch only new data since then.

---

## 6. `credentials`: Securely Handling Authentication

Credentials are **never** stored directly in the workflow JSON. Instead, only a reference to the credentials securely stored in the n8n instance is saved.

### How Credentials are Referenced in JSON

Let's look at the `httpRequest` node again:

```json
{
  // ... other node properties
  "parameters": {
    "authentication": "predefinedCredential",
    "credentialType": "httpHeaderAuth",
    // ...
  },
  "credentials": {
    "httpHeaderAuth": {
      "id": "42",
      "name": "My API Auth"
    }
  }
}
```

1.  `parameters.authentication` specifies that we are using stored credentials.
2.  `parameters.credentialType` specifies the type, e.g., `httpHeaderAuth`, `oAuth2Api`, etc.
3.  The `credentials` object at the main level of the node contains the actual reference.
    *   The key (`httpHeaderAuth`) must match the `credentialType`.
    *   `id`: This is the crucial piece of information—the ID of the credential in the n8n database.
    *   `name`: The name of the credential. This is mainly for readability; the `id` is what matters for functionality.

### Best Practices for Managing Credentials

*   **Never Hardcode Sensitive Data:** Never insert API keys, passwords, or tokens directly into a node's `parameters`. Always use n8n credentials.
*   **Use IDs, Not Names:** When moving workflows between instances, ensure the credential `id` exists and is correct in the target instance. You may need to write scripts to create credentials and update the IDs in the JSON.
*   **Anonymize Before Sharing:** If you share a workflow JSON, remove the entire `credentials` object from the nodes to prevent leaking IDs and names.

---

## 7. Expressions in JSON: The Dynamics of n8n

Expressions are what make n8n workflows dynamic. They allow you to access data from previous nodes, transform it, and use it in the parameters of subsequent nodes.

### The Anatomy of n8n Expressions

Expressions are enclosed in double curly braces: `{{ ... }}`. Inside, you use a JavaScript-like syntax.

*   `$json`: Accesses the `json` object of the current item. Example: `{{ $json.name }}`.
*   `$items('nodeName')`: Accesses the output of a specific, previous node. This returns an array of all items from that node. Example: `{{ $items('Read from Sheet')[0].json.email }}`.
*   `$node`: A more modern and often simpler syntax to access the output of a previous node. Example: `{{ $node["Read from Sheet"].json["email"] }}`.
*   `$execution.id`: Accesses metadata of the current workflow execution.
*   JavaScript Methods: You can use many built-in JavaScript functions, e.g., `{{ $json.name.toUpperCase() }}` or `{{ new Date().toISOString() }}`.

### Using Expressions in Node Parameters

In your JSON, an expression is represented as the string value of a parameter.

```json
"parameters": {
  "message": "Welcome, {{ $json.user.firstName }}!",
  "values": {
    "string": [
      {
        "name": "email",
        "value": "={{ $node[\"Get User Data\"].json.email }}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important Note:** Some fields in the n8n UI are explicitly marked as "Expression". In the JSON structure, you often recognize this by the value starting with `={{...}}` instead of just `{{...}}`, or the expression being in a field named `expression`. The safest method is to configure a node in the UI and then export the JSON to see the correct structure.

## 8. Practical Guides and Advanced Techniques

### Programmatically Creating a Workflow from Scratch

Here is a simple JavaScript example that dynamically creates a workflow:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto'); // Available in Node.js

function createSimpleWorkflow(name, webhookPath, message) {
  const webhookNodeId = crypto.randomUUID();
  const setNodeId = crypto.randomUUID();

  const workflow = {
    name: name,
    nodes: [
      {
        parameters: {
          path: webhookPath,
          httpMethod: 'GET',
          responseMode: 'lastNode'

        typeVersion: 1,
        position: [250, 300]
      },
      {
        parameters: {
          values: {

// Usage:
const workflowJson = createSimpleWorkflow(
  'Dynamic Workflow',
  'my-dynamic-hook-123',
  'This workflow was created by code!'
);
console.log(workflowJson);
```

This script generates a complete, valid n8n workflow JSON that you can import via the n8n API.

### Versioning Workflows with Git

1.  **Export Your Workflows:** Export each workflow as a separate `.json` file. Give the files meaningful names.
2.  **Initialize a Git Repository:** Create a new Git repository and add your JSON files.
3.  **Commit and Push:** Make an initial commit and push it to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab).
4.  **Track Changes:** Every time you modify a workflow in the n8n UI, export it again, overwriting the old file. `git diff` will show you exactly what has changed. This is incredibly valuable for auditing and tracking changes.
5.  **CI/CD Integration (Advanced):** Set up a CI/CD pipeline that listens for commits to your repository. The script can then use the n8n API to automatically import and activate the changed workflow in your n8n production instance.

### Handling Loops and Iterations in JSON

n8n doesn't have an explicit "Loop" node. Looping is implemented by n8n's core design: **every node executes once for each item it receives as input.**

To implement a loop, you can:

1.  **SplitInBatches Node:** Divide a large list of items into batches.
2.  **Sub-Workflow (Execute Workflow):** Create a sub-workflow that processes the logic for a single item.
3.  **Main Workflow:** Use the SplitInBatches node and then call the sub-workflow for each batch or item.

In the JSON, this would be represented by a node of type `n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow`, which points to the ID of the sub-workflow.

## 9. Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

### Validating Your Workflow JSON

Since there is no official public JSON schema, the best way to validate is to **import it into an n8n instance**. A development or local n8n instance is essential for this. If the import fails, the n8n UI or server logs will often provide a hint about the problem.

### Common Errors

*   **Duplicate Node IDs:** Every `id` in the `nodes` array must be absolutely unique.
*   **Invalid Connections:** A connection references a non-existent node `id` or a non-existent port.
*   **Missing `typeVersion`:** Don't forget to specify the `typeVersion` for each node.
*   **Syntax Errors in Expressions:** A typo in a `{{ ... }}` expression can cause the entire node to fail.
*   **Incorrect `credentials` Structure:** The credential `id` or `name` doesn't match the configuration in the n8n instance.
*   **JSON Formatting Errors:** A missing comma, an extra bracket, etc., can make the entire file unreadable. Always use a linter.

### Tips from the n8n Community

*   **The "Copy-Paste" Trick:** The easiest way to get the JSON structure for a specific node is to build it in the n8n UI, select it, copy it (Ctrl+C), and paste it into a text editor. This gives you the exact JSON for that node.
*   **Browse GitHub Repositories:** There are numerous public repositories with n8n workflow examples. Analyzing these files is an excellent learning resource.
*   **Build Incrementally:** When creating a complex workflow programmatically, start simple and add nodes and connections step-by-step. Test after each step.

## 10. The Future: n8n Agents and AI-Driven Workflows

With the rise of AI agents, n8n is also evolving. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into workflows is becoming increasingly common.

### How AI Agents Manifest in the JSON Structure

An AI agent in n8n is often a combination of several nodes:

1.  An **LLM node** (e.g., `n8n-nodes-base.openAiChat`) to execute the core logic.
2.  A **tool system**, where the LLM node can use other n8n nodes (like `httpRequest` or `set`) as "tools."

In the JSON, you will see this through special parameters in the LLM node:

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "prompt": "Summarize the following text: {{ $json.text }}",
    // ...
    "tools": { // Definition of tools the agent can use
      "values": [
        {
          "tool": "httpRequest", // Referencing the tool by name
          "node": "HTTP Request" // Name of the node in the workflow that implements this tool
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Structured Data Output from AI Models

One of the biggest challenges when working with LLMs is getting reliable, structured output (e.g., JSON). n8n nodes for AI often provide features for "Function Calling" or "Structured Output."

In the JSON of the `openAiChat` node, this might look like:

```json
"parameters": {
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "prompt": "Extract the name and email address from the text.",
  "jsonOutput": true, // Request a JSON output
  "outputSchema": "{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"title\": \"User\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"email\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"email\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"name\", \"email\"]\n}"
}
```

Directly editing these JSON structures allows for the creation of highly complex, AI-driven agents that can dynamically react to various tasks.

## 11. Summary and Resources

The n8n workflow JSON is more than just a storage file; it's a powerful interface that allows developers to unlock the full potential of n8n. By understanding the structure of `nodes`, `connections`, `parameters`, and `credentials`, you can programmatically create, version, and manage workflows.

This guide has given you a deep and comprehensive insight into the anatomy of the n8n workflow JSON. From the basics to advanced techniques and AI integration, you now have the knowledge to master workflows on a level that goes far beyond the visual user interface.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Every workflow is a JSON document.
*   The core components are `nodes` and `connections`.
*   Each node has a `type`, an `id`, and specific `parameters`.
*   Connections are defined using node IDs and port indexes.
*   Credentials are referenced securely, not embedded.
*   Expressions (`{{ ... }}`) bring dynamism to your workflows.
*   The best way to learn is to build workflows in the UI and inspect the resulting JSON.

Use this knowledge to build more robust, scalable, and intelligent automations with n8n.
