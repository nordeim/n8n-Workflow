**Core and Action Nodes**:
The documentation lists a vast array of core and action nodes, demonstrating n8n's extensive integration capabilities.
*   **Core Nodes:** Examples include Activation Trigger, Aggregate, AI Transform, Code, Compare Datasets, Compression, Chat Trigger, Convert to File, Crypto, Date & Time, Debug Helper, Edit Fields (Set), Edit Image, Email Trigger (IMAP), Error Trigger, Evaluation, Execute Command, HTTP Request, If, Manual Trigger, Merge, Remove Duplicates, Schedule Trigger, Send Email, Sort, Split Out, Stop And Error, Summarize, Switch, Wait, Webhook, Workflow Trigger, XML, and many more. Many of these nodes also have dedicated "Common issues" sections.
*   **Action Nodes:** A wide range of integrations are listed, covering various categories such as CRM (Airtable, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce), Communication (Discord, Gmail, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp Business Cloud), Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive), Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase), AI/ML (OpenAI, DeepL, Jina AI, LingvaNex, Perplexity, xAI Grok Chat Model), Marketing (ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, ConvertKit), Project Management (Asana, ClickUp, Jira, Trello, monday.com), and many more. Each action node often includes specific operations (e.g., Gmail has Draft, Label, Message, and Thread operations) and common issues sections.

**AI Agent Node Specifics**:
The **AI Agent** is described as an **autonomous system** that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The "environment" refers to everything the agent can access that is not itself. A key capability of the AI agent is its ability to **understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task**. To function, an **AI Agent node must be connected to at least one tool sub-node**.

**Agent Types (Historical Context)**:
Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent node had a setting for different agent types. This setting has since been removed, and **all AI Agent nodes now function as a Tools Agent**. The Tools Agent was the recommended and most frequently used setting, ensuring backward compatibility for workflows or templates created with older versions as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent'.

**AI Agent Templates and Resources**:
Several templates and examples are available for AI agents, including "AI agent chat" and "AI agent that can scrape webpages". Related resources point to LangChain's documentation on agents, n8n's blog introduction to AI agents, and n8n's Advanced AI documentation. Common issues for the AI Agent node are also addressed.

**AI Glossary**:
The source includes an AI glossary with important terms:
*   **Completion:** Responses generated by models like GPT.
*   **Hallucinations:** When a Large Language Model (LLM) mistakenly perceives non-existent patterns or objects.
*   **Vector Database (Vector Store):** Stores mathematical representations of information, used with embeddings and retrievers to create a database accessible by AI for answering questions.

**Cloud and Source Control Features**:
n8n Cloud offers a free trial, access to an admin dashboard, version updates, timezone settings, IP addresses, data management, and options to change ownership or username. Concurrency control and workflow downloads are also mentioned.

These indicate common use cases and pre-built solutions within the n8n ecosystem. The integration categories span Development, Communication, Langchain, AI, Data & Storage, Marketing, Productivity, Sales, Utility, and Miscellaneous.

### Excerpts from "Dealing with errors in workflows - n8n Docs"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Strategies for Error Handling and Troubleshooting in n8n Workflows
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source focuses on troubleshooting and handling errors within n8n workflows, emphasizing that workflow executions can fail for various reasons, from configuration issues to third-party service failures. It provides methods to identify and respond to these errors.

**Checking Failed Workflows**:
n8n tracks all workflow executions, and when a workflow fails, users can investigate the cause using the **Executions log**.
*   **Accessing the Log:** The Executions log can be accessed by selecting "Executions" in the left-side panel.
*   **Log Details:** The log displays information such as the latest execution time, status (e.g., failed), mode, and running time for saved workflows.
*   **Investigating Failures:** To examine a specific failed execution, users can select its name or the "View" button. This action opens the workflow in a read-only mode, providing a visual representation of each node's execution and helping pinpoint where the issue occurred.
*   **Toggling Views:** A "Editor | Executions" button at the top of the page allows switching between the execution view and the workflow editor.

**Catching Erroring Workflows with Error Workflows**:
A proactive approach to error management is to create a dedicated **Error Workflow**.
*   **Purpose:** This separate workflow is designed to execute specifically when a main workflow fails.
*   **Error Trigger Node:** The core component of an Error Workflow is the **Error Trigger node**. This node initiates the Error Workflow when an error occurs in a monitored workflow.
*   **Custom Notifications:** Users can integrate additional nodes into their Error Workflow, such as those for sending notifications via email or communication platforms like Slack, Discord, or Telegram, to inform teams about failed workflows and their errors.
*   **Setting up an Error Workflow:** To receive error messages, the main workflow's settings must be configured to point to the designated Error Workflow that utilizes an Error Trigger node.
*   **Activation:** Workflows containing an Error Trigger node do not need to be manually activated. By default, if a workflow includes an Error Trigger node, it automatically designates itself as its own error workflow.
*   **Testing Limitations:** Error workflows cannot be tested when workflows are run manually; they only trigger when an automatic workflow encounters an error.
*   **Reusability:** The same Error Workflow can be assigned to monitor multiple workflows.

**Exercise Example for Error Workflow**:
The source provides a step-by-step exercise to create an Error Workflow:
1.  **Create a new Error Workflow.**
2.  **Add the Error Trigger node.**
3.  **Connect a communication node** (e.g., Slack, Discord, Telegram, Gmail, or Send Email) to the Error Trigger node.
4.  **In the monitored workflow's settings, select the newly created Error Workflow.** This main workflow needs to be set to run automatically for the error workflow to trigger.

A JSON workflow code example illustrates an Error Workflow communicating via Slack:
```json
{
   "nodes": [
      {
         "parameters": {},
         "name": "Error Trigger",
         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger",
         "typeVersion": 1,
         "position": [
            720,
            -380
         ]
      },
      {
         "parameters": {
            "channel": "channelname",
            "text": "=This workflow {{$node[\"Error Trigger\"].json[\"workflow\"][\"name\"]}}failed.\nHave a look at it here: {{$node[\"Error Trigger\"].json[\"execution\"][\"url\"]}}",
            "attachments": [],
            "otherOptions": {}
         },
         "name": "Slack",
         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
         "position": [
            900,
            -380
         ],
         "typeVersion": 1,
         "credentials": {
            "slackApi": {
               "id": "17",
               "name": "slack_credentials"
            }
         }
      }
   ],
   "connections": {
      "Error Trigger": {
         "main": [
            [
               {
                  "node": "Slack",
                  "type": "main",
                  "index": 0
               }
            ]
         ]
      }
   }
}
```
This JSON snippet demonstrates how the Error Trigger node's output, specifically the workflow name and execution URL, can be dynamically used in a Slack message via expressions to provide detailed error context.

**Throwing Exceptions with Stop and Error Node**:
Another debugging and error control mechanism is the **Stop and Error node**, which allows users to deliberately throw an error within a workflow.
*   **Error Types:** Users can specify the error type:
    *   **Error Message:** Returns a custom message about the error.
    *   **Error Object:** Returns the type of error.
*   **Placement:** The Stop and Error node can only be used as the *last* node in a workflow.
*   **Use Cases:** Throwing exceptions is particularly useful for **validating data or assumptions about data** from preceding nodes and returning custom error messages. This is critical when dealing with data from third-party services that might have issues like:
    *   Incorrectly formatted JSON output.
    *   Data with the wrong type (e.g., non-numeric values for numeric data).
    *   Missing values.
    *   Errors originating from remote servers.
By throwing an error early when a problem is detected, it prevents later, harder-to-trace issues caused by invalid data. An example image shows a Stop and Error node configured with an error message.

It reiterates popular integrations (Google Sheets, Telegram, MySQL, Slack, Discord, Postgres, Notion, Gmail, Airtable, Google Drive) and trending templates (AI agent chat, scrape and summarize webpages with AI). The integration categories are consistent, including Development, Communication, Langchain, AI, Data & Storage, Marketing, Productivity, Sales, Utility, and Miscellaneous. These elements reinforce the broader context of n8n as a versatile automation platform.

### Excerpts from "Expressions - n8n Docs"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Dynamic Parameter Setting and Data Manipulation with n8n Expressions
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source details **Expressions**, a powerful feature in n8n that allows for **dynamic parameter setting** in nodes. Expressions enable users to set parameter values based on data originating from previous node executions, the current workflow, or the n8n environment. They also facilitate the execution of JavaScript, offering a convenient way to manipulate data without extensive custom code.

**Core Concepts of Expressions**:
*   **Templating Language:** n8n uses its own templating language called **Tournament**, which is extended with custom methods, variables, and data transformation functions to simplify common tasks like accessing data from other nodes or workflow metadata.
*   **Libraries Support:** n8n expressions additionally support two external JavaScript libraries:
    *   **Luxon:** For working with dates and time.
    *   **JMESPath:** For querying JSON data.
*   **Data Structure Importance:** Understanding n8n's data structure is crucial when writing expressions.

**Writing Expressions**:
To use an expression to set a parameter value:
1.  **Hover over the parameter** where the expression is needed.
2.  **Select "Expressions"** from the "Fixed/Expression" toggle.
3.  **Write the expression** directly in the parameter field, or open the **expressions editor**. The expressions editor includes a "Variable selector" to browse available data.
4.  **Format:** All expressions must follow the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

**Examples of Expressions**:

*   **Example: Get data from webhook body**
    This example demonstrates extracting specific data from a webhook's JSON body. If a webhook receives data like this:
    ```json
    [
       {
          "headers": {
             "host": "n8n.instance.address",
             ...
          },
          "params": {},
          "query": {},
          "body": {
             "name": "Jim",
             "age": 30,
             "city": "New York"
          }
       }
    ]
    ```
    To extract the value of `"city"` (e.g., "New York") in a subsequent node, the following expression can be used:
    `{{ $json.body.city }}`
    This expression utilizes n8n's custom `$json` variable to access incoming JSON data. It also demonstrates JMESPath syntax for querying JSON, but notes that `{{$json['body']['city']}}` is also a valid alternative.

*   **Example: Writing longer JavaScript**
    Expressions are limited to **a single line of JavaScript**, meaning they cannot handle variable assignments or multiple standalone operations. The source illustrates this limitation with an example using the Luxon library to calculate the difference between two dates in months.
    **Invalid n8n expression:**
    ```javascript
    // This example is split over multiple lines for readability
    // It's still invalid when formatted as a single line
    {{
    function example () {
        let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
        let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');
        let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');
        return diffInMonths.toObject();
    }
    example();
    }}
    ```
    **Valid n8n expression:**
    ```javascript
    {{ DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}}
    ```
    This shows that complex logic needs to be condensed into a single returnable statement within the expression or handled by a **Code node** if more extensive JavaScript is required.

**Common Issues**:
The source points to a "Common Issues" section for troubleshooting expression-related errors.

**General n8n Features and Integrations Context**:
Similar to other documentation excerpts, this source also provides a general overview of n8n's documentation structure, including learning paths, components, data handling, flow logic, and various core and action nodes. It reiterates popular integrations (Google Sheets, Telegram, MySQL, Slack, Discord, Postgres, Notion, Gmail, Airtable, Google Drive) and trending templates (AI agent chat, scrape and summarize webpages with AI). The integration categories are consistent, including Development, Communication, Langchain, AI, Data & Storage, Marketing, Productivity, Sales, Utility, and Miscellaneous. These elements highlight the broad applicability of expressions within the n8n ecosystem.

### Excerpts from "Extracting structured data from OpenAI responses in n8n workflow - Latenode community"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Community Discussion on Extracting Structured JSON from OpenAI Responses in n8n
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source is a community forum discussion centered on the challenge of **extracting specific information (like names and locations) from customer messages processed by OpenAI within an n8n workflow**, with the goal of ensuring the output is in a **consistent and easy-to-handle JSON format**. The user provides an example of the desired JSON output structure:

```json
{
   "response": "Hello! What should I call you?",
   "extracted_data": [
      {
         "key": "Location",
         "data": [{ "text": "Miami" }]
      },
      {
         "key": "Customer",
         "data": [{ "text": "Tom" }]
      }
   ]
}
```
This specific JSON format includes a general response and an `extracted_data` array containing objects with `key` and nested `data` (which itself is an array of objects with a `text` field). The main question is how to configure the OpenAI node to reliably generate this structured output.

**Proposed Solutions and Advice from the Community**:

*   **Prompt Engineering and Post-processing (Finn_Mystery)**:
    *   **Detailed Prompt Crafting:** One effective approach is to **craft a detailed prompt** in the OpenAI node that explicitly instructs the model to format its response in the desired JSON structure.
    *   **Include Examples:** It is crucial to **include examples within the prompt** to guide the AI model's output. This helps the model understand and replicate the expected format.
    *   **Function Node for Validation/Cleanup:** After the OpenAI node, add a **Function node** to validate and clean up the JSON output if necessary. This two-step process (prompting + post-processing) can lead to more consistent and reliable outputs.
    *   **Fine-tuning and Fallback:** It's important to **fine-tune prompts over time** as edge cases are encountered. Additionally, implementing a **fallback mechanism** is recommended for instances where the structure isn't perfect, to prevent workflow failures.

*   **Function Calling Feature and Code Node (CreativeArtist88 & emmad)**:
    *   **Utilize Function Calling:** A strong recommendation is to leverage OpenAI's **function calling feature** for structured output. This is highlighted by two different community members as an effective method.
    *   **Define Clear JSON Schema:** The process involves **defining a clear JSON schema** that precisely outlines the desired output structure. This schema acts as a contract for the AI.
    *   **Set up Function with Parameters:** In the OpenAI node, set up a function with parameters that directly match the intended output format.
    *   **Instruct Model to Use Function:** Crucially, instruct the model to use this defined function for its responses.
    *   **Code Node for Parsing and Validation:** After receiving the output, use a **Code node** to parse and validate the JSON. This ensures consistency and simplifies data extraction.
    *   **Error Handling and Refinement:** For reliability, it is advisable to implement **error handling and fallback options** in case the AI model deviates from the expected format. Regular testing and refinement of prompts are also essential for maintaining accuracy over time.

In summary, the community discussion converges on a multi-faceted strategy involving careful **prompt design with examples**, utilizing **OpenAI's function calling feature** with a predefined JSON schema, and employing **post-processing steps with n8n's Function or Code nodes for validation and error handling** to ensure reliable structured JSON output from AI models.

### Excerpts from "How to generate a json output with an ia agent - Questions - n8n Community"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Community Guidance on Generating JSON Output with n8n AI Agents
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source documents a community question regarding how to make an **AI agent generate JSON code** in n8n, indicating that the user had already attempted various methods without success. The question specifically relates to AI agents (referred to as "ia agent") and their output format.

**Key Solutions for JSON Output from AI Agents**:

*   **Require Specific Output Format Toggle:** The primary solution proposed by the community is to **toggle the "Require Specific Output Format" switch** within the AI agent node's settings. This setting instructs the AI to adhere to a predefined output structure. A screenshot illustrates this toggle, showing it as a clear option within the node's configuration.

*   **Structured Output Parser:** After enabling the specific output format, it is necessary to **connect a "Structured Output Parser" node**. This node is used in conjunction with the AI agent to interpret and enforce the desired JSON structure.

*   **Providing an Example JSON:** To guide the Structured Output Parser and the AI agent, users must **provide an example JSON**. This example serves as a template for the expected output format. A visual representation of this setup is provided, showing the Structured Output Parser connected and configured with an example JSON.

*   **Handling Special Characters and Errors**:
    A common challenge with AI-generated JSON is the inclusion of characters that can break the JSON format, such as triple backticks (````` ` ``). To mitigate this, several strategies are suggested:
    1.  **Strict Prompting:** Give the AI agent a **strict prompt not to use special characters** that might invalidate the JSON structure. This involves careful instruction engineering to guide the AI's output.
    2.  **Enable Retries:** Configure the workflow or the AI node to **enable retries**. This allows the system to re-attempt generation if the initial output is malformed, increasing reliability.
    3.  **Error Output and Handling:** Enable **error output** and implement a comprehensive **error handling process**. At a minimum, this could involve sending a notification to the user or team when a malformed JSON output occurs, allowing for manual intervention or further troubleshooting. This aligns with best practices for robust workflow design.

The discussion implies that correctly combining the "Require Specific Output Format" setting, the "Structured Output Parser" with an example JSON, and robust error handling measures are crucial for consistently generating valid JSON output from AI agents in n8n. The topic was closed after 90 days, suggesting the provided solutions were considered sufficient.

### Excerpts from "How to handle large data/files in n8n? - Questions"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Community Strategies for Managing Large Data and Files in n8n Workflows
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source is a community forum discussion addressing a critical operational challenge in n8n: **how to handle incoming, processing, and outgoing large data or files, specifically examples like a 40MB file or a JSON array containing approximately 30,000 objects**. The user describes an issue where n8n consumes a significant amount of memory (~2GB) and 100% CPU, leading to crashes, even with 3GB of RAM allocated to the Docker container. The workflow example given involves an HTTP Request receiving a large JSON array, a Function node modifying each object, and a Spreadsheet node converting JSON to CSV. The central question is how to configure n8n or its environment to efficiently manage such workflows without crashes.

**Proposed Solutions and Best Practices**:

1.  **Increase RAM (Less Efficient Route)**:
    While increasing the RAM allocation of the environment (e.g., beyond 3GB for the Docker container) can help, it is explicitly stated as **not the most efficient route**. It's a direct scaling solution but might not address underlying processing inefficiencies for very large datasets.

2.  **Subworkflows with Batch Processing (Recommended)**:
    *   **Create a Subworkflow:** The **best way** suggested is to create a separate **subworkflow** specifically designed to handle the intensive data processing.
    *   **Split in Batches Node:** Within the main workflow, use the **Split in Batches node** to send data to the subworkflow in smaller, manageable chunks. This prevents overwhelming the system by processing all data simultaneously. An image illustrates this concept, showing a main workflow passing data in batches to a subworkflow.
    *   **Clearing Data in Subworkflow:** To prevent the processed data from being returned and still accumulating in the main workflow's memory, a "Set node" can be used in the subworkflow to **clear data** by keeping only set items and running only once. Alternatively, a Code node can be used to return a single empty item (`return [{json:{}}];`). This ensures that only the processed results, not the large raw data, continue in the main workflow.
    *   **Memory Alleviation:** Using the Split in Batches node in conjunction with subworkflows alleviates memory pressure by ensuring that the function or processing node handles only one batch at a time, rather than attempting to process 100 simultaneous function calls on large data. The key insight here from a core n8n developer is that the `SplitInBatches` node alone will **not** positively impact memory use because n8n keeps *all* workflow data in memory. Therefore, **splitting into different workflows (subworkflows) is truly required** for effective memory management with large datasets.

3.  **Environment Variable for Binary Data (`N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=filesystem`)**:
    For workflows dealing with **large binary data**, setting the environment variable `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=filesystem` is crucial. This configuration directs n8n to **save binary data to disk instead of memory and the database**, significantly reducing RAM requirements. The user confirmed they were already using this setting, indicating that for their specific JSON array case, it wasn't the sole solution, reinforcing the need for subworkflows.

4.  **Avoid Manual Execution via UI for Large Data**:
    *   **Browser Limitations:** When workflows with large datasets are run manually through the n8n UI, n8n has to send all the data to the browser. Browsers are not built to handle such large amounts of data, which can cause the browser to crash.
    *   **Increased Memory Consumption:** Manual UI execution also forces n8n to create a copy of the data to send to the browser, leading to a temporary but significant increase in required memory.
    *   **Recommended Approach:** Instead, it is highly suggested to **add an HTTP Request node, activate the workflow, and then call its production URL**. This method consumes less memory and is less likely to crash the workflow or the UI. However, even after trying this, the user's workflow still crashed, further highlighting the necessity of subworkflows or more RAM for their specific scenario.

In conclusion, for handling large data and files in n8n, the most effective strategies involve **architecting workflows with subworkflows and batch processing using the `Split in Batches` node**, particularly when dealing with non-binary data that remains in memory. For binary data, the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=filesystem` environment variable is critical. Additionally, avoiding manual UI executions for heavy workflows is advised to conserve memory and prevent browser issues. When these optimizations are insufficient, increasing allocated RAM remains an option, though less efficient.

### Excerpts from "Learn JSON Basics with an Interactive Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners - N8N"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Interactive Tutorial for Understanding JSON Basics and its Use in n8n Workflows
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source introduces an interactive, hands-on tutorial designed to teach **the absolute basics of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** and, more importantly, **how to use it within n8n**. It is specifically tailored for beginners new to automation and data structures, providing a structured series of simple steps.

**How the Tutorial Workflow Works**:
The tutorial is structured as a series of simple steps, with each node introducing a new, fundamental concept of JSON.
*   **Key/Value Pairs:** The tutorial starts with the basic building block of all JSON: **key/value pairs**.
*   **Data Types:** It then guides the user through the most common data types one by one:
    *   **String:** Represents text.
    *   **Number:** Includes both integers and decimals.
    *   **Boolean:** Can be either `true` or `false`.
    *   **Null:** Represents "nothing" or the absence of a value.
    *   **Array:** An ordered list of items.
    *   **Object:** A collection of key/value pairs.
*   **Using JSON with Expressions:** The tutorial emphasizes this as the "most important step". It demonstrates **how to dynamically pull data from a previous node into a new one using n8n's expressions**, which are enclosed in double curly braces `{{ }}`.
*   **Final Exam:** A final node consolidates all learned concepts by building a complete JSON object that references data from all the preceding steps.

**Interactive Learning Features**:
*   **Sticky Notes:** Each node in the tutorial workflow is accompanied by a **detailed sticky note** that explains the concept in simple terms.
*   **Execution and Observation:** Users are instructed to execute the workflow, then click on each node sequentially (from top to bottom), observe the output in the right-hand panel, and read the corresponding sticky note to understand the displayed information.

**Setup Steps (Zero Setup)**:
The tutorial workflow requires **no setup time**. Users simply need to click the "Execute Workflow" button to run it and follow the instructions provided in the main sticky note. The goal is for users to gain a solid understanding of JSON and its application in n8n workflows by the end of the tutorial.

### Excerpts from "Understanding the data structure - n8n Docs"
*(Source ID:)*
**Description/Title:** Core Data Structure and Transformation in n8n Workflows
**URL:** As this is an excerpt, a direct URL is not provided in the source.

This source provides a fundamental explanation of the **data structure within n8n** and demonstrates how to use the **Code node for data transformation and simulating node outputs**. It establishes that n8n nodes operate as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool, where data is extracted from sources, modified, and then passed along.

**n8n's Required Data Structure: Array of Objects**:
*   The data flowing between nodes in an n8n workflow **must be in a recognized and interpretable format**, which is an **array of objects**.
*   **Arrays:** Defined as ordered lists of values, where each element is stored at an index starting from 0. Example: `["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Donatello", "Raphael"]`.
*   **Objects:** Store key-value pairs, where the order is not important, and values are accessed by referencing the key name. Example:
    ```json
    {
       name: 'Michelangelo',
       color: 'blue',
    }
    ```
*   **Array of Objects:** An array that contains one or more objects. This is the fundamental structure for data in n8n. Example (Ninja turtles):
    ```javascript
    var turtles = [
       {
          name: 'Michelangelo',
          color: 'orange',
       },
       {
          name: 'Donatello',
          color: 'purple',
       },
       {
          name: 'Raphael',
          color: 'red',
       },
       {
          name: 'Leonardo',
          color: 'blue',
       }
    ];
    ```
*   **Accessing Object Properties:** Properties within an object can be accessed using **dot notation**, e.g., `object.property` or `turtles.color` to get the color of the second turtle.
*   **Items:** Data sent from one node to another are referred to as **items**, which are elements in this collection of JSON objects. An n8n node processes its action on **each item of incoming data**.

**Creating Data Sets with the Code Node**:
The Code node can be used to **create custom data sets or simulate node outputs**.
*   **Required `json` Key:** n8n expects each object within the array to be **wrapped in another object with the key `json`**.
    Example of Code node output structure:
    ```javascript
    return [
       {
          json: {
             apple: 'beets',
          }
       }
    ];
    ```
    For the Ninja turtles example, the structure in the Code node would be:
    ```json
    [
       {
          "json": {
             "name": "Michelangelo",
             "color": "orange"
          }
       },
       {
          "json": {
             "name": "Donatello",
             "color": "purple"
          }
       },
       {
          "json": {
             "name": "Raphael",
             "color": "red"
          }
       },
       {
          "json": {
             "name": "Leonardo",
             "color": "blue"
          }
       }
    ]
    ```
    **Automatic `json` Key Addition:** Importantly, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) **automatically adds the `json` key** if a user forgets to include it in an item.
*   **Nested Pairs:** For nested data (e.g., primary and secondary colors), key-value pairs need to be further wrapped in curly braces `{}`.
*   **Exercise Example: Creating `myContacts` Array**:
    An exercise demonstrates creating an array of contacts with nested email properties in a Code node:
    ```javascript
    var myContacts = [
       {
          json: {
             name: 'Alice',
             email: {
                personal: 'alice@home.com',
                work: 'alice@wonderland.org'
             },
          }
       },
       {
          json: {
             name: 'Bob',
             email: {
                personal: 'bob@mail.com',
                work: 'contact@thebuilder.com'
             },
          }
       },
    ];
    return myContacts;
    ```
    Executing this Code node yields the expected JSON array of objects.

**Referencing Node Data with the Code Node**:
Similar to expressions, the Code node allows referencing data from other nodes using specific methods and variables.
*   **Exercise Example: Adding `workEmail` Column**:
    Building on the `myContacts` example, a second Code node can be connected to add a new column `workEmail` by referencing the existing `work` email property of the first contact:
    ```javascript
    let items = $input.all();
    items.json.workEmail = items.json.email['work'];
    return items;
    ```
    This code snippet demonstrates accessing incoming items via `$input.all()`, modifying an item's JSON data, and returning the updated items.

**Transforming Data**:
Incoming data from some nodes may not match n8n's required data structure, necessitating transformation for individual item processing. Two common operations are:
*   **Creating multiple items from one item.**
*   **Creating a single item from multiple items.**

**Methods for Data Transformation**:
*   **n8n's Data Transformation Nodes:**
    *   **Split Out node:** Separates a single data item containing a list (array) into multiple individual items, without needing JavaScript.
    *   **Aggregate node:** Groups separate items, or portions of them, together into individual items.
*   **Code node for JavaScript Functions:** The Code node can be used in "Run Once for All Items" mode to write JavaScript functions for data structure modification.
    *   **Creating multiple items from a single item:** If an item has a key named `data` set to an array of items (e.g., `[{ "data": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`):
        ```javascript
        return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {
           return { json: item }
        });
        ```
    *   **Creating a single item from multiple items:**
        ```javascript
        return [
           {
              json: {
                 data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)
              }
           }
        ];
        ```
    These examples assume transformation of the entire input, but operations can be performed on specific fields by identifying them in the `items` list. Example:
    ```javascript
    let items = $input.all();
    return items.json.workEmail.map(item => {
       return { json: item }
    });
    ```
*   **Exercise Example: PokéAPI Data Transformation**:
    An exercise demonstrates fetching data from the PokéAPI (`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`) with an **HTTP Request node**. It then shows how to transform the `results` field using both the **Split Out node** (setting "Field To Split Out" to `results` and "Include" to `No Other Fields`) and the **Code node** with the following JavaScript:
    ```javascript
    let items = $input.all();
    return items.json.results.map(item => {
       return { json: item }
    });
    ```
This source provides essential insights into n8n's internal data handling and the powerful capabilities of the Code node and dedicated transformation nodes for managing data structure.

*   **Quality Standards:** Workflows must be functional, tested, have all credentials and sensitive data removed, follow naming conventions, be compatible with recent n8n versions, and include meaningful descriptions.
*   **Security & Privacy:** All workflows are shared "as-is" for educational purposes. Users must **review before use, update credentials, test safely in development, and check permissions**.
*   **Compatibility:** Compatible with n8n 1.0+ (most workflows). Some may require community node installations or account for API changes in external services.

The repository represents a significant community effort to organize and document n8n workflows, providing a valuable resource for developers and automation engineers.
