awesome guide! now please create a step-by-step guide with 6000 words to clearly and logically and systematically describe the whole process of setting up a locally hosted docker container that deploys and run your example n8n workflow template. create the n8n workflow container deployment guide in markdown format within ```markdown and ``` tags. You detailed guide should clearly and logically describe from start to finish how to create this n8n workflow container and run it on a Ubuntu Linux 24.04.01 host machine. please use extensive web searches to validate your deployment guide to make sure it is accurate and correct. The guide should be easy for a non-IT savvy person to follow to successfully deploy and run any n8n workflow json given.
