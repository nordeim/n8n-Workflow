You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Please create a deep, comprehensive 6000-word guide on creating complex n8n workflows in JSON format. This is a technical tutorial request that needs:

1. A complex example workflow in JSON format
2. Detailed explanations of each JSON element
3. Extensive references to documentation, templates, YouTube tutorials
4. Tips for customization

You are to structure this guide thoughtfully:

1. Introduction to n8n and JSON workflows
2. Understanding the n8n JSON workflow structure
3. Complex example workflow (You will create a multi-step automation)
4. Detailed breakdown of each element
5. References throughout
6. Customization tips
7. Best practices
8. Resources for further learning

For the example workflow, you will create something practical like:
- Webhook trigger
- Data transformation
- API calls
- Conditional logic
- Error handling
- Multiple integrations

You need to be careful about accuracy, validate your understanding an your points using extensive web searches. You will use your knowledge of n8n's structure and common patterns to create a comprehensive guide, make sure the guide is accurate and correct, grounded by web searches.

awesome guide! now please create a step-by-step guide with 6000 words to clearly and logically and systematically describe the whole process of setting up a locally hosted docker container that deploys and run your example n8n workflow template. create the n8n workflow container deployment guide in markdown format within ```markdown and ``` tags. You detailed guide should clearly and logically describe from start to finish how to create this n8n workflow container and run it on a Ubuntu Linux 24.04.01 host machine. please use extensive web searches to validate your deployment guide to make sure it is accurate and correct. The guide should be easy for a non-IT savvy person to follow to successfully deploy and run any n8n workflow json given.

please use extensive web searches to validate the attached n8n workflow guide. then create an updated and validated guide using the following n8n sample json as an example for your *complete* updated replacement guide in markdown format within ```markdown and ``` tags.

Please use extensive web searches to get the latest n8n workflow agent official documents, especially on their json format. Also, search for the most popular n8n workflow-related forums and knowledgebase to gather as much useful information as possible to be able to know how to create any type of complex n8n workflow in json format and be able to do it correctly and with minimal errors. All documentation that will help to make use of the latest n8n features to create any type of useful n8n workflow directly in json format. Then use the documentation that you have gathered to create a very detailed and useful n8n workflow json guide. Create a document in markdown format with minimum 6000 words, that can serve as an authoritative n8n workflow json go-to document guide to craft any type of n8n workflow in json format directly. Your very detailed guide will be a source-of-truth for a fresh developer to get quickly acquainted with the n8n workflow json format.

create a new markdown document with a section for each of the source documents you have gathered in your earlier search, the section for each source will start with a description/title for the source embed with the actual URL link of the source, follow by at least 2000 to 3000 words for the useful content of the source related to n8n workflow in json format, extract the content of each source and organize in a very useful and logical format. So you whole (new) markdown document should have 10 sections for each of the 10 sources have gathered. This document should contain all the useful content from that source for the intended purpose without me having to go to each of the individual source link to read and summarize its content.
