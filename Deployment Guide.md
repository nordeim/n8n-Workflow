## Introduction: Your Private AI Powerhouse {#introduction}

Welcome! You are about to embark on a journey to transform your computer into a private, powerful, and secure automation platform. This guide will walk you through every single step of deploying a sophisticated n8n AI Agent workflow using Docker on an Ubuntu 24.04 system. We assume no prior IT or coding knowledge; every command and concept will be explained in detail.

### Why Self-Host n8n with Docker?

While n8n offers a convenient cloud service, self-hosting gives you the ultimate power and control:
*   **Data Privacy & Security:** Your data, workflows, and credentials never leave your machine. You control the entire environment.
*   **No Limits:** You are only limited by the power of your computer, not a subscription plan. Run as many workflows and executions as you need.
*   **Full Customization:** You can configure the environment precisely to your needs, install community nodes, and manage data persistence your way.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Beyond the cost of your computer and electricity, it's free.

### What is Docker and Docker Compose? (A Simple Analogy)

Imagine you want to build a complex LEGO model. Instead of giving you a 1000-page manual and a giant bag of loose bricks, the manufacturer gives you pre-built sections in perfectly labeled boxes. Box A is the foundation, Box B is the walls, Box C is the roof. All you have to do is place them next to each other, and they click together perfectly.

*   **Docker is the system of creating those labeled boxes (called "images" and "containers").** An n8n container is a self-contained box with n8n and all its dependencies already installed and configured to work. You don't have to worry about what's inside; you just run it.

*   **Docker Compose is the blueprint that tells you how to arrange the boxes.** Our n8n setup needs two boxes: one for the n8n application itself, and one for its database (to store your workflows). The `docker-compose.yml` file is a simple text file that says, "Put the n8n box here, put the database box there, and connect them in this specific way."

This approach turns a potentially very complex installation process into a few simple, repeatable commands.

### The End Goal

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional, locally hosted n8n instance. You will have imported and configured a two-part AI Agent workflow that can control a web browser, and you will know how to send it a command from your terminal and watch it work.

---

## Part 1: Preparing Your Ubuntu Host Machine {#part-1-preparing-your-ubuntu-host-machine}

Before we can build our n8n fortress, we need to prepare the ground. This involves ensuring our operating system is up-to-date and secure.

### 1.1. A Word on the Command Line

Throughout this guide, we will use the command-line interface, also known as the **Terminal**. It's a powerful way to give direct instructions to your computer.

You can open the Terminal on Ubuntu by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or by finding "Terminal" in your applications menu. You will see a prompt, likely ending in a `$` sign, where you can type commands. Don't be intimidated! We will provide the exact commands to copy and paste.

### 1.2. Updating Your System: The First and Most Important Step

First, let's ensure all the existing software on your Ubuntu system is up to the latest version. This prevents a huge number of potential conflicts and security issues.

Open your Terminal and type the following command, then press Enter.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

You will be prompted for your password. Type it and press Enter. *Note: You will not see characters appear as you type your password. This is a security feature.*

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `sudo`: This stands for "Super User Do." It's like saying, "Run the following command with administrator privileges," which is necessary for system-wide changes.
*   `apt`: This is Ubuntu's package manager, the tool used to install, update, and remove software.
*   `update`: This command doesn't actually update anything. It just downloads the latest list of available software packages from Ubuntu's servers.
*   `&&`: This is a simple connector. It means, "If the first command (`apt update`) succeeds, then run the second command."
*   `upgrade -y`: This command compares the list of software you have installed with the new list we just downloaded. It then downloads and installs all the updates. The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to any confirmation prompts, making the process smoother.

This command might take a few minutes to complete, depending on how many updates are needed.

### 1.3. Creating a Dedicated User for Security

While you can do everything with your main user account, it's a security best practice to create a separate, non-root user specifically for managing services like Docker and n8n.

First, create the new user. We'll call them `n8nuser`.

```bash
sudo adduser n8nuser
```

The system will ask you to set a password for this new user and then to confirm it. Choose a strong password. After that, it will ask for some optional information (Full Name, etc.). You can just press Enter to skip through all of these. Finally, confirm the information is correct by typing `Y`.

Next, we need to give this new user the ability to run commands with `sudo` (administrator privileges), just like your main account.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo n8nuser
```

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `usermod`: A command to *mod*ify a *user* account.
*   `-aG`: This means **a**ppend the user to a **G**roup.
*   `sudo`: This is the name of the group that grants administrator privileges.
*   `n8nuser`: The user we are adding to the group.

Now, let's switch to our new user to perform the rest of the setup.

```bash
su - n8nuser
```

Enter the password you just created for `n8nuser`. Your terminal prompt will change to `n8nuser@...:~$`, confirming you are now operating as the new user.

---

## Part 2: Installing the Docker Engine and Docker Compose {#part-2-installing-the-docker-engine-and-docker-compose}

Now we will install the "engine" that runs our containers.

### 2.1. Installing Docker: The Easy Way

While there are several ways to install Docker, the most straightforward method for a fresh system is to use the official convenience script. This script automatically detects your OS and installs the latest stable version of Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

First, download the script using `curl`, a tool for transferring data from servers.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `curl`: The command to run the tool.
*   `-fsSL`: These are flags. `-f` makes it fail silently on server errors, `-s` runs it in silent mode, `-S` shows an error if it fails, and `-L` follows any server redirects.
*   `https://get.docker.com`: The address of the installer script.
*   `-o get-docker.sh`: This tells `curl` to save the output to a file named `get-docker.sh` instead of just printing it to the screen.

Now, run the script you just downloaded using `sudo`.

```bash
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

This will run for a few minutes, printing out a lot of information as it installs Docker and all its required components.

### 2.2. The Most Common Pitfall: Granting Docker Privileges

By default, only the system's root user (or users with `sudo`) can run Docker commands. This is inconvenient and can cause permission issues later. To fix this, we add our current user (`n8nuser`) to the `docker` group, which was created during installation.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `${USER}`: This is a system variable that automatically contains the name of the currently logged-in user (in our case, `n8nuser`). This is a neat trick to avoid typing the username again.

**THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:** This change will not take effect in your current Terminal session. You must either log out and log back in, or simply open a brand new Terminal window. For simplicity, close your current Terminal and open a new one (`Ctrl + Alt + T`). Then, switch back to your dedicated user:

```bash
su - n8nuser
```

Enter the `n8nuser` password again. Now, your new session will have the correct permissions.

### 2.3. Verifying Your Docker Installation

Let's check that everything worked. In your new terminal, type the following commands. You should now be able to run them *without* `sudo`.

Check the Docker version:
```bash
docker --version
```
Expected Output (version number may vary):
```
Docker version 27.0.3, build 7d41127
```

Check the Docker Compose version:
```bash
docker compose version
```
Expected Output (version number may vary):
```
Docker Compose version v2.27.0
```

Finally, run the traditional "hello-world" test. This command downloads a tiny test image and runs it in a container.
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
If successful, you will see a message that includes:
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```
Success! Your host machine is now fully prepared.

---

## Part 3: Structuring Your n8n Project {#part-3-structuring-your-n8n-project}

Organization is key. We will create a dedicated folder to hold our n8n configuration files.

### 3.1. Creating the Project Directory

Let's create this folder in our user's home directory.
```bash
mkdir ~/n8n-deployment
```
**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `mkdir`: The **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory command.
*   `~`: A shortcut for your current user's home directory (e.g., `/home/n8nuser`).

Now, navigate into that new directory. This is where we will work from now on.
```bash
cd ~/n8n-deployment
```

### 3.2. Crafting the `docker-compose.yml` Blueprint

This is the most important file. It's the blueprint for our n8n service. We will create and edit it using `nano`, a simple and beginner-friendly terminal-based text editor.

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

This command opens a blank file in the `nano` editor. Copy the entire block of text below and paste it into your terminal.
*   **To paste into most terminals, use `Ctrl + Shift + V`.**

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_POSTGRESDB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${DB_POSTGRESDB_USER} -d ${DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - DB_TYPE=postgresdb
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=${DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE}
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=${DB_POSTGRESDB_USER}
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=${DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD}
      - N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      - WEBHOOK_URL=${WEBHOOK_URL}
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  n8n_data:
```

Once pasted, save the file and exit `nano`:
1.  Press `Ctrl + O` (the letter 'O', for Output) to write the file.
2.  `nano` will ask for the "File Name to Write". It will already say `docker-compose.yml`. Just press **Enter**.
3.  Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

You are now back at the command prompt.

### 3.3. Deep Dive: Understanding the `docker-compose.yml` File

Let's break down what you just created. This file defines two `services` (containers): `postgres` and `n8n`.

**The `postgres` service:**
*   `image: postgres:15`: Use the official PostgreSQL database image, version 15.
*   `restart: always`: If this container ever crashes or the system reboots, Docker will automatically restart it.
*   `environment`: These lines set up the database by creating a user, password, and database name. The values like `${DB_POSTGRESDB_USER}` are placeholders that we will define in a separate, secure file.
*   `volumes: - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: This is critical for data persistence. It links a Docker-managed "volume" on our host machine called `postgres_data` to the folder inside the container where Postgres stores its data. This means even if we delete the container, our data remains safe in this volume.
*   `healthcheck`: This is an advanced feature that repeatedly checks if the database is actually ready to accept connections before allowing the n8n container to start.

**The `n8n` service:**
*   `image: n8nio/n8n:latest`: Use the official n8n image, always pulling the latest version.
*   `environment`: This sets the configuration for n8n itself, telling it how to connect to the database we defined above. It also sets placeholders for a security key and webhook URL.
*   `ports: - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"`: This maps a port on your host machine to a port inside the container.
    *   The `5678` on the right is the port n8n listens on *inside* its container.
    *   The `5678` on the left is the port on *your computer* that you will use to access n8n.
    *   `127.0.0.1` means only allow connections from your computer itself (localhost). This is a crucial security measure.
*   `volumes: - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n`: Just like with the database, this saves all your n8n data (workflows, credentials, etc.) to a persistent volume on your host machine.
*   `depends_on`: This tells Docker "Do not start the `n8n` service until the `postgres` service reports that it is healthy and ready."

## Part 4: Configuring n8n with an Environment File {#part-4-configuring-n8n-with-an-environment-file}

Notice all the `${...}` placeholders in the `docker-compose.yml` file? We need to define those values. It is a best practice to put sensitive information like passwords and keys in a separate file called `.env`. Docker Compose automatically reads this file and makes the values available to the containers.

### 4.1. Creating the `.env` Secrets File

In the same `~/n8n-deployment` directory, create the `.env` file with `nano`.

```bash
nano .env
```

### 4.2. Populating Your `.env` File

Copy the block below and paste it into the `nano` editor (`Ctrl + Shift + V`).

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST change the placeholder values for the passwords and the encryption key. Use a password manager to generate long, random, and unique strings for these values.

```ini
# PostgreSQL Database Settings
# Replace 'your_strong_db_password' with a strong, unique password.
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=your_strong_db_password

# n8n Specific Settings
# Replace 'your_very_long_and_random_secret_key' with a long, unique, random string.
# This key is CRITICAL for securing your credentials. BACK IT UP!
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_very_long_and_random_secret_key

# Webhook URL for local setup
WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678/
```

**After pasting and replacing the placeholder values**, save and exit `nano` (`Ctrl + O`, Enter, `Ctrl + X`).

### 4.3. Deep Dive: Understanding Your Environment Variables

*   **`DB_...` variables**: These define the username, password, and database name that both the `postgres` container will use to initialize itself, and the `n8n` container will use to connect. The `USER` and `DATABASE` can be `n8n`, but the `PASSWORD` must be a secret you create.
*   **`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`**: This is the single most important security setting. n8n uses this key to encrypt all the credentials you save (like API keys and passwords) before storing them in the database. **If you lose this key, you will lose access to all your credentials forever.** Store a copy of it in a secure password manager.
*   **`WEBHOOK_URL`**: This tells n8n its own public-facing address. Since we are running it locally and accessing it via `localhost`, this is the correct value. It's used to generate webhook URLs for your trigger nodes.

---

## Part 5: Launching, Accessing, and Managing Your n8n Container {#part-5-launching-accessing-and-managing-your-n8n-container}

With our blueprint (`docker-compose.yml`) and secrets (`.env`) in place, we are ready to launch.

### 5.1. The Magic Command: Bringing n8n to Life

Make sure you are in the `~/n8n-deployment` directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `docker compose`: The command to use the Docker Compose tool.
*   `up`: This command reads the `docker-compose.yml` file, pulls the necessary images (`postgres:15` and `n8nio/n8n`), creates the persistent volumes (`postgres_data`, `n8n_data`), and starts the containers with the specified configuration.
*   `-d`: This stands for "detached mode." It runs the containers in the background and returns you to the command prompt, so you can close the terminal without stopping n8n.

The first time you run this, it will take a few minutes to download the images. Subsequent starts will be much faster.

### 5.2. Checking the Logs: Is it Working?

To see what your containers are doing, you can view their real-time logs.
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
You will see a stream of output from both the `postgres` and `n8n` containers. You are looking for a message from the `n8n` container that says `Editor is now available on http://localhost:5678/`. This confirms n8n has started successfully.

Press `Ctrl + C` to stop viewing the logs (this will not stop the containers, which are running in the background).

### 5.3. Accessing the n8n Web Interface

Open your favorite web browser (like Firefox or Chrome) and navigate to the following address:

`http://localhost:5678`

If everything worked, you will be greeted with the n8n "Set up owner account" screen.

### 5.4. Your First Login: Creating an Owner Account

This screen only appears the very first time you start n8n. Fill in your information to create the main administrator account for your instance. This is separate from the `n8nuser` you created on the Ubuntu system.

Once you create the account, you will be taken to the main n8n canvas. Congratulations! You have a fully functional, private automation platform running on your own machine.

### 5.5. Essential Management Commands

Here are the commands you will use to manage your instance. You must run them from the `~/n8n-deployment` directory.

*   **To stop n8n:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
    This stops and removes the containers, but your data in the volumes is safe.

*   **To start n8n again:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

*   **To check the status of your containers:**
    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```
    This will show you if the `n8n` and `postgres` services are running.

## Part 6: Importing and Configuring the AI Browser Agent {#part-6-importing-and-configuring-the-ai-browser-agent}

Now, let's load the powerful AI agent workflow from our previous guide into your new n8n instance.

### 6.1. The Two-Workflow System: Agent and Tool

The "Ultimate Browser Agent" is actually composed of *two* separate workflows:
1.  **The Main Agent Workflow:** This contains the chat trigger, the agent, the language model, and the memory. It's the brain.
2.  **The Sub-Workflow Tool:** This is a smaller workflow whose only job is to perform a specific action: starting a browser session. The main agent calls this workflow as a "tool".

We must create and configure both.

### 6.2. Creating the "Start Browser" Sub-Workflow

Let's create the tool first.
1.  In your n8n UI, click the `+` button in the top left and select "New Workflow".
2.  Click the three dots (`...`) in the top right, and choose "Import from JSON".
3.  Paste the following JSON code into the text box and click "Import".

```json
{
  "name": "Sub-Workflow - Start Browser",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {},
      "id": "e49f8b4d-9e99-4c6e-812e-419b4b0e8b23",
      "name": "When Executed by Another Workflow",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger",
      "typeVersion": 1.1,
      "position":
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "sessionId": "={{ $random.hex(12) }}",
        "message": "Browser session started successfully."
      },
      "id": "3c9a2c3a-2391-4952-b91c-99d7a2283e58",
      "name": "Set Session Info",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.set",
      "typeVersion": 3.4,
      "position":
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "When Executed by Another Workflow": {
      "main": [
        [
          {
            "node": "Set Session Info",
            "type": "main",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {},
  "staticData": null
}
```
*Note: This is a simplified mock tool for this guide. A real one would use a service like Airtop to actually start a browser.*

4.  Click the "Save" button.

### 6.3. Importing and Configuring the Main "Ultimate Browser Agent"

1.  Go back to your main workflow list and create another new workflow (`+` -> "New Workflow").
2.  Again, click the three dots (`...`) and "Import from JSON".
3.  This time, paste the full JSON for the "Ultimate Browser Agent" from the previous guide.
4.  Click "Import" and then "Save".

You now have both workflows in your n8n instance.

### 6.4. Setting Up Credentials: The Keys to the Kingdom

The imported agent workflow needs API keys to talk to its language model (OpenRouter) and its browser tools (Airtop).
1.  In the left-hand navigation pane, click "Credentials".
2.  Click the "Add credential" button.
3.  In the search box, type `OpenRouter` and select it.
4.  Give it a name (e.g., "My OpenRouter Key") and paste your actual OpenRouter API key into the `API Key` field. Click "Save".
5.  Repeat the process for the browser tool. Click "Add credential", search for `Airtop`, and enter your Airtop API key.
6.  Now, go back to your "Ultimate Browser Agent" workflow.
7.  Click on the "3.5 Sonnet" node. In the `Credential for OpenRouter API` dropdown, select the credential you just created.
8.  Do the same for all the browser tool nodes (`Query`, `Load URL`, `Type`, `Click`, `End Session`). Click on each one and select your Airtop credential from the dropdown menu.
9.  Click **Save** in the top right to save these changes.

### 6.5. Linking the Sub-Workflow: Giving the Agent its Tool

Now we need to tell the main agent the ID of the sub-workflow it should use as a tool.
1.  Go to your list of workflows and open the "**Sub-Workflow - Start Browser**" you created.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look something like this: `http://localhost:5678/workflow/2` or `http://localhost:5678/workflow/aBcDeFg123`. The part after `/workflow/` is the ID. In this case, `2` or `aBcDeFg123`. Copy this ID.
3.  Now, go back and open the main "**Ultimate Browser Agent**" workflow.
4.  Click on the "**Start Browser**" tool node.
5.  In the `Workflow ID` field on the right, paste the ID you just copied.
6.  Click **Save** one more time.

### 6.6. Activating Your Workflows

A workflow will not run unless it is active.
1.  On the "Ultimate Browser Agent" workflow canvas, find the toggle switch in the top right that says "Inactive". Click it to turn it to "**Active**".
2.  Do the same for the "Sub-Workflow - Start Browser" workflow.

Your AI Agent is now fully configured, armed, and ready for commands.

## Part 7: Interacting With and Testing Your Deployed Agent {#part-7-interacting-with-and-testing-your-deployed-agent}

The agent is triggered by a chat message sent to a specific webhook URL.

### 7.1. Finding Your Agent's Communication Endpoint

1.  Open the "Ultimate Browser Agent" workflow.
2.  Click on the trigger node, "**When chat message received**".
3.  On the right-hand panel, you will see the webhook URLs. For a local setup, you need the **Test URL**. It will look something like `http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/5098f362-c62a-4b7b-9370-0129f90e8553`.
4.  Click the copy icon next to the Test URL.

### 7.2. Sending a Chat Message with `curl`

Let's send a test command from our Ubuntu Terminal. `curl` is perfect for this. Paste the following command into your terminal, **replacing `YOUR_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URL you just copied.**

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"message": "Please start a browser session for me."}' \
'YOUR_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL'
```

**Understanding the 'Why':**
*   `curl -X POST`: Sends the request using the HTTP POST method, which is standard for submitting data.
*   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: This is a header that tells the server we are sending data in JSON format.
*   `-d '{"message": "..."}'`: This is the data (`-d`) we are sending. The n8n Chat Trigger expects a JSON object with a `message` key.

When you press Enter, you won't see much output in the terminal, but you have just triggered your agent.

### 7.3. Observing the Magic in the Executions Log

1.  Go back to your n8n web UI.
2.  In the left-hand navigation pane, click "Executions".
3.  You should see a new entry at the top for your "Ultimate Browser Agent" workflow. Click on it.

You are now looking at the execution log. You can see the path the data took, represented by green lines. You can click on each node to inspect the input and output data at every step of the agent's thought process. You can see it receive your message, call the "Start Browser" sub-workflow, and get a result.

## Part 8: Maintenance, Updates, and Troubleshooting {#part-8-maintenance-updates-and-troubleshooting}

### 8.1. How to Update Your n8n Instance

Because we used the `n8nio/n8n:latest` image tag, updating is simple. Run these commands from your `~/n8n-deployment` directory:

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest n8n image from Docker Hub
docker compose pull n8n

# 2. Re-create the n8n container with the new image
docker compose up -d
```
This will gracefully stop your old container and start a new one using the updated image, while all your data remains intact thanks to the persistent volume.

### 8.2. Common Troubleshooting Steps

*   **"Permission Denied" when running `docker` commands:** You forgot to add your user to the `docker` group, or you didn't start a new terminal session after doing so. See step 2.2.
*   **`localhost:5678` refuses to connect:**
    *   Run `docker compose ps` to see if the containers are running.
    *   If not, run `docker compose logs -f` to check for error messages at startup. It's often a typo in the `.env` file.
*   **Workflow fails with an error:** Open the failed run in the "Executions" log. It will highlight the node that failed in red and provide a detailed error message, which is the best clue to what went wrong (e.g., an invalid credential, a misconfigured tool).
*   **Forgot your `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:** You cannot recover it. Your only option is to stop n8n, delete the `n8n_data` volume (`docker volume rm n8n-deployment_n8n_data`), create a new key in your `.env` file, and start over. This is why backing it up is critical.
